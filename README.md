# Simple Quote API created in Go

I am learning the Go language and how to create things using Go.

The purpose of this repo is so I can compare what is required to create a functional API and then compare to a .net minial api, which I already have experience with.

Target is to build something that can:

- integrate with other components (e.g. a data store)
- have some unit tests
- built in a way that could sustainably be grown
- have a build and deploy process
- test out linting tools and cli
